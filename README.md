Monolith to Microservices at Scale Project
In this project, you will apply the skills they have acquired in this cloud engineering course to design, deploy and operate a cloud native photo sharing application. You will reuse your existing application and convert and extend into a microservice architecture. The microservice architecture makes it more easier to scale it to large systems. They are great enablers for continuous integration and delivery too. This includes independent scaling, independent releases and deploymentsâ€Š and independent development so that ACH service has its own codebase. After the application is divided into smaller services, you will containerize it and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes deployment pipeline, scalability, observability, Services, Networking and deployment strategies to service the system. You will implement and be required to interpret performance, usage, and logs to solve real problems similar to those they would encounter in the field.

The project will highlight the your ability to build microservice and cloud native application. The process will loosely follow a development flow used by lean, quick start ups.
